# TRK Valuables

**TRK Valuables** is a custom R.E.P.O. mod that introduces unique valuables based on 3D models personally created in Blender and Blockbench.  
These assets add collectible depth to gameplay, ranging from ornate statues and trophies to variously sized asteroids and even a short sword.

- **Big Asteroid is oversized**: It cannot fit through standard doors.

  `Failed to register valuable "Valuable Trophy". Valuable prefab already exists in Resources with the same name.`
